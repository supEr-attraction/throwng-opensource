[Throwng](https://www.sieum.co.kr/) is a location-based music sharing open-source platform based on the insight that the music you listen to varies depending on the place. This repo is the primary source for core development on the Throwng platform. It's written in Java and React and runs as a single Linux binary with MySQL and MongoDB. A new compiled version is released under an MIT license every month.

Deploy Throwng on-premises, or try it for free in the cloud.
